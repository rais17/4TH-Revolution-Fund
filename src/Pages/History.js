Outside the general background technological progress being known, your daily life and the general human condition had not meaningfully changed since the days of Ancient Greece other than the increased number of machines and better nutrition. This industrial revolution largely benefited only the capitalist owners, undermining the aristocracy and causing a drop off in the quality of life for the working class. The Napoleonic Wars had a big effect in causing the revolution to continue past the point it would have otherwise ended by delaying the industrialization of Europe until it all started happening at once.`,

This was the era of an economic recession as a result of the end of the industrial revolution, of technological refinements to what came before, the maturation of the telegraph, and the birth of the technologies that would later define the Second Industrial Revolution, such as the telephone, recorded sound, automobiles, atomic physics, modern medicine and germ theory, and more. Otherwise, little changed in the daily life of the average person.`,

For the first time, technological change had a direct effect on the human condition, changing the quality of life for even the poor. The Industrialization of life itself wrought great optimism, but it also directly led to the bloodshed of the first World War.`,

      article: `Second Foundation Period: 1915-1945. Capped by the First and Second World Wars, this was an era where the fruits of the Second Industrial Revolution really ripened and matured, but the rate of world changing innovations slowed in the meantime. The foundations for the Third, Digital Revolution were established, but technological limitations prevented a flourishing. The average futurist of this era would have been flummoxed at where the great innovations of the previous generation had gone, and why it had all been replaced by countries and reloading for another pointless world war. Of course, innovative discoveries and inventions still happened, such as jet propulsion, digital computing, penicillin, nuclear power, space exploration, and the Chemical Revolution. However, the innovations of the Second Industrial Revolution wrought great horrors upon the world due to society developing slower than technology. Most notably through the rise of totalitarianism, fascism, communism, and industrial genocide`,

The human condition changed at a rate so extreme that the future was no longer easily predictable based on past performance. In fact, even the poorest could now live better than kings of olde.`,

We were still getting in rattly elevators, driving our own cars, planting on our food, flipping off light switches, walking to places we wanted to be, hanging out with friends in meat-space, shopping in physical stores, and otherwise living lives that could best be described as "high-tech 1970s."`,

There were no holograms. There were no colonies on the moon or Mars. Militaries weren't using ray guns or force fields. We weren't becoming cyber-augmented transhumans. We weren't living in mile-high starscrapers. Buildings were still rectangles in the sky. The best chatbots were still Markov chains that didn't understand anything past the fourth thing you told it. And even though we got some form of home robots with the Roomba, it was the dumbest thing imaginable. It felt like even the Ancient Greeks could have developed something like it. Plasma screen TVs and big stereoes were a poor replacement for the future we were promised. As has been mentioned before, this was the era of a yuppie with a pager and PDA bicycling to work while a Boeing 747 flies above the smoggy, boxy metropolis filled with rose-petal highways. In some ways, that was futuristic, if you compared it to life in, say, rural France in the 1600s. But compared to our sci-fi visions of tomorrow, this was the lamest possible future imaginable.`,

The best robots could barely walk without being tethered, and ASIMO seemed to almost be light years ahead of the competition just because it could navigate stairs reliably. This was supposed to be the technology that replaced human workers? Even if you claimed it wouldn't happen for another century, it was a hard sell.`,
